# lsd - Larastud.io Docker Deploy

This is a Laravel Docker Deploy setup based on Li0nel's one at https://github.com/li0nel/laravel-docker-compose. 
It is being worked one right now with several updates. Idea is that this can be added to Laravel App root and
run from there to set up your Docker Server with the needed images to run Laravel.
